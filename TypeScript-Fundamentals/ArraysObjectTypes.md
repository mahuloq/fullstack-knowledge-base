# Arrays-and-Object-Types

Can use static types on objects, by declaring what you wish the entry to be.
let person: {
name: string;
age: number;
};

can store an array of those objects

let people: {
name: string;
age: number;
}[];

can also store arrays
let hobbies: string[];

hobbies = ["Sports", "Cooking", "12 here as number, would not work"];
