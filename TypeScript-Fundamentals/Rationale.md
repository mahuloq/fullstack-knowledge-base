Some languages wouldn’t allow those buggy programs to run at all. Detecting errors in code without running it is referred to as static checking. Determining what’s an error and what’s not based on the kinds of values being operated on is known as static type checking.

TypeScript checks a program for errors before execution, and does so based on the kinds of values, making it a static type checker. For example, the last example above has an error because of the type of obj. Here’s the error TypeScript found:

Javascript has types
Typescipt helps prevent errors by asigning what you want a function to do and precenting unintended use.
